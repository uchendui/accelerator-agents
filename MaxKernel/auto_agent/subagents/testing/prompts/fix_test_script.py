PROMPT = """You are tasked with checking validation results and fixing any errors in a generated pytest test file.

## Context

Test file path: `{test_file_path?}`

**Validation Results:**
- Syntax Validation: {syntax_validation?}
- Import Validation: {import_validation?}
- Test Structure Validation: {structure_validation?}
- Mock Execution Validation: {mock_execution_validation?}

## First: Check if a Test File Exists

**If `test_file_path` is empty or not provided:**
- Respond: "❌ No test file was generated. Cannot fix a non-existent file. Please generate a test file first."
- **STOP HERE**

## Second: Check if Fixes are Needed

**Check each validation result:**
1. If `syntax_validation.valid == True` AND `import_validation.valid == True` AND `structure_validation.valid == True` AND `mock_execution_validation.valid == True`
   - **All validations passed! No fixes needed.**
   - Respond: "✓ Test file validation passed. No fixes required."
   - **STOP HERE - do not modify the file**

2. If ANY validation has `valid == False`:
   - **Fixes are needed - proceed to Step 3**

## Tool Usage

You have tools to help you:
1.  **`search_api`**: For looking up specific API definitions and signatures when you need precise technical details about JAX, Pallas, or pytest APIs to fix validation errors.
2.  **`read_file`**: To read the test file and understand the current code.
3.  **`restricted_write_file`**: To overwrite the test file with the corrected version.

## Your Task (Only if Fixes are Needed)

Analyze the validation errors and fix the test file to resolve ALL validation issues.

### Step 1: Read the Current Test File

Use the `read_file` tool to read the test file and understand the current code.

### Step 2: Analyze the Validation Errors

Review each validation failure:

1. **Syntax Errors**: These indicate Python syntax problems (missing colons, parentheses, quotes, etc.)
   - Fix by correcting the Python syntax at the specified line numbers

2. **Import Errors**: These indicate that imports cannot be resolved
   - Check if the imported modules/files exist
   - Verify the import paths are correct relative to the test file location
   - Ensure kernel files exist at the expected paths
   - Fix import statements to use correct paths/module names

3. **Structure Errors**: These indicate pytest cannot find or collect tests
   - Ensure test functions start with `test_`
   - Ensure test classes start with `Test`
   - Verify test functions are properly defined inside test classes
   - Check that pytest can discover the tests

4. **Mock Execution Errors**: These indicate runtime errors when executing the test file against the baseline (e.g., logic issues, assertion failures)
   - Fix by correcting the test logic or parameters to ensure tests pass successfully when evaluating functionality
   - Use `search_api` to verify correct API usage if errors suggest incorrect parameters or signatures

### Step 3: Fix the Issues

**CRITICAL RULES:**
1. **DO NOT change the test logic or functionality** - only fix validation errors
2. **DO NOT modify the actual kernel implementations** - only fix the test file
3. **Keep all test classes and test methods** - just fix syntax/import/structure issues
4. Focus ONLY on making the test file valid Python code with correct imports and pytest structure
5. **Numerical Tolerance**: Each tolerance is a float, or a list with one value per output leaf in `jax.tree_util.tree_leaves` order. Pass lists unchanged. Use the specified tolerances: atol={atol?}, rtol={rtol?}. If they are not specified, default to atol=1e-3, rtol=1e-3.
6. **Output Ordering**: Pass sort_outputs={sort_outputs?} unchanged. When true, sort every output leaf along its last axis before comparison.
7. **Input Generation**: Ensure that if the base kernel file (`{base_kernel_path?}`) defines an input generation function (e.g. `create_inputs`), it is reused/imported and used directly.

### Step 4: Write the Fixed Test File

Use the `restricted_write_file` tool to overwrite the test file with the corrected version.

**After writing:**
- Confirm: "Fixed test file written to {test_file_path}"
- Summarize what was fixed

## Important Notes

- The goal is to ensure the test file itself is **syntactically correct and can be imported**
- We are NOT fixing kernel bugs - only test file bugs
- After your fixes, the validation will run again automatically
- If validation still fails after your fixes, you may be called again to fix remaining issues
